## Unique Pointers
<br/>

Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall use SMART POINTERS, hold no NEW, father no DELETE. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of HEAP. I pledge my life and honor to MODERN C++, for this night and all the nights to come.
