## Ring Shaped Buffer Data Structure
<br/>

This Data Structure was developed to test C++11 Template Classes Nesting. Instantiating a RingBuffer object creates a buffer of a fixed capacity that overflows to the beggining when full. 

A buffer with size 3, when added the elements 1, 2, 3, 4 will end up containing:
    4 in the first position 
    2 in the second position 
    3 in the third position
