# DailyCodingChallenges

I am doing one C++ coding session a day. Whithin this files there are dozens of algorithms and contributions to other projects. Most days I start a new  mathematical or data management coding challenge and I submit a correct and efficient solution to it. Time Complexity of the solution provided is displayed at the bottom of each file.
